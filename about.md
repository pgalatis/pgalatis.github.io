I'm Panos Galatis, a Senior Technician working for Northumbria University. This is my "About" page where, you know, I'm supposed to blab about *myself*. To be honest with you, however, I don't like talking about myself and I also find most "About" pages to be downright boring---oftentimes even redundant. 

I won't, therefore, pretend I'm someone important; I'm not and I don't want to be. I'm just an average guy, an art conservator by education, and a tech geek. I enjoy coding in all flavors of HTML and CSS; I like writing technical documentation as clearly and concisely as I possibly can; I love drawing, sketching, and painting and, of course, I adore reading. This page is simply my little playground, a place where I can experiment and rant if you wish. 

And that's basically all I can say without becoming a bore. In any case, if you really want to know more about me, you should probably just visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgalatis/">LinkedIn profile</a>.
