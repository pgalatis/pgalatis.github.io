<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm Panos Galatis, a Technical Author and Communicator with a passion for quite a few things, including technology, science, data analytics, coding, and quality management. This site is more of a playground and a repository for my own thoughts and opinions on various topics rather than a serious attempt to create a meaningful corner on the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> :)</p>
<p>For more information, feel free to visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgalatis/" title="LinkedIn profile">LinkedIn profile</a>. You can also say <a href="mailto:pgalatis@gmail.com?subject=Hi" title="Email me!">hi</a> by dropping me a good-old fashioned email.</p>
