I'm Panos, an Art Conservator by education and Web Designer turned Technical Author by choice. In all, I'm an average guy who enjoys hand-coding in all flavors of HTML and CSS, likes writing concise and clear technical documentation, loves drawing, sketching, and painting, and adores reading. 

This page is nothing more than my own little playground, a place where I can experiment and rant if you wish. If you'd like to know more about me, you should probably visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgalatis/">LinkedIn profile</a>.
