I have recently been looking at ways to publish a Technical Photography Guide I had written for the programme I am working at. This guide has to be published under a CC License and be available online. 
Thankfully, after quite a bit of research, I came across a number of amazing online projects such as [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) 
and [Penflip](http://www.penflip.com) that allow an author to write content in Markdown and publish it in diferent formats (epub, pdf etc.).

While I am not a professional photographer per se, as an Art Conservator I am quite experienced in different Technical Photography methods and techniques 
and I do believe that such knowledge should always be made available to peers for free. I have unfortunately come across "professional photographers" in the past 
that were quite secretive and/or reluctant to make their knowledge available to their peers.

Well, all I can say is "stay tuned"!
