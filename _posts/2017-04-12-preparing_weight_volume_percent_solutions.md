One of the questions that keep popping up every now and then from fellow colleagues is "How do I prepare a 15% w/v solution of this solute into this solvent"?

Well, the answer is pretty easy. Weight per volume percent solutions are defined as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
C = \frac{m}{V} x 100
\end{align}
$$

Where *C is Concentration of the solution*, *m is mass of the solute in grams* and *V is volume of the total solution*. This is usually expressed as grams of solute/100 mL of solution but it could be as easily expressed in L (liters) of solution.

So, what does that tell us? Let me give you an example. Let's suppose that we need to prepare a 10% w/v solution of NaCl in an aqueous solution. This is of course nothing else than our well-known table salt. What do we do?

1. We weigh 10 grams of NaCl.
2. We fill a beaker with water up to the 50 mL mark and stir our solution.
3. We top up our beaker until the 100 mL mark.

And that's it! We now have a 10% w/v solution of NaCl in H2O!

What's confusing for some people though is that they believe that they have to weigh their solute and then add 100 mL of solvent. This is **not** the case. Weight/Volume percent concentration is the mass of the solute over the **total** volume of the solution. Always try to keep that in mind.

Here's another one. Say that you have just found a jar of some solution that does not mention the concentration *but* it mentions the mass of the solute and the volume of the solution, e.g. 150 g of NaCl in 600 mL of water. How would you calculate the w/v concentration of that one? Well, as it turns out that's pretty simple! Remember our formula from above? Just plug in the numbers and you have your answer!

$$
\begin{align}
C = \frac{150{}g}{600{}mL} x 100 = 0.25 x 100 = 25%
\end{align}
$$

So, the concentration of your solution is 25% w/v or 25 g/100 mL. And that's all!

More on solutions in the next post where I'll be talking about dilution. Hint: Have you noticed how our concentration formula above is exactly the same as the density formula?
