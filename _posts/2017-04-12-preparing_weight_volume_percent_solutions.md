One of the questions that keep popping up every now and then from fellow Conservators is "How do I prepare a 15% w/v solution of this solute into this solvent"?

Well, the answer is pretty easy. Weight per volume percent solutions are defined as follows:

$$
Concentration of solute = \frac{mass of solute}{Volume of solution} x 100
$$

This is usually expressed as grams of solute/100 mL of solution but it could be as easily expressed in L of solution.

So, what does that tell us? Let me give you an example. Let's suppose that we need to prepare a 10% w/v solution of NaCl in an aqueous solution. This 
is of course nothing else than our well-known table salt more or less. What do we do?

1. We weigh 10 grams of NaCl.
2. We fill a beaker of water up to the 50 mL mark and stir our solution.
3. We top up our beaker until the 100 mL mark.

And that's it! We now have a 10% w/v solution of NaCl in H2O!

What's confusing for some people though is that they believe that they have to weigh their solute and then add 100 mL of solvent. 
This is **not** the case. Weight/Volume percent concentration is the mass of the solute over the **total** volume of the solution. Always try to keep that in mind.

Here's another one. Say that you have just found a jar of some solution that does not mention the concentration *but* it mentions the mass of the solute 
and the volume of the solution, e.g. 150 g of NaCl in 600 mL of water. How would you calculate the w/v concentration of that one? 
Well, it turns out that it's pretty simple! Remember our formula from above?

$$
Concentration of solute = \frac{mass of solute}{Volume of solution} x 100
$$
 
Well, just plug in the numbers and you have your answer!

$$
Concentration of solute = \frac{150 g}{600 mL} x 100 = 0.25 x 100 = 25%
$$

So, the concentration of your solution is 25% w/v. And that's all!
