Linux or more correctly GNU/Linux has been one of my on/off passions from 1997 or thereabouts. Since then I've used Apple Macs, Windows machines 
and of course performed countless installations of various flavours of Linux on a wide range of hardware. I've had many sleepless nights and have 
dedicated many hours of my life manually editing config files to make hardware work, installing packages etc.

In 2003 I became a fervent advocate of Free and Open Source Software by setting up a website (http://promote-opensource.org) which is now long dead. 
Since then many things have changed. One of them is that I, unfortunately, started using Linux less and less eventually settling 
for a MacBook Pro which became my faithful companion for more than 5 years (it is needless of course to say at this point that I was 
dual-booting Linux not with much success though). 

About 4 months ago I bought a Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series. At first I used the 
default Windows 10 installation it came with until about a month ago when I decided to install Ubuntu 16.10 on it. And guess what! I simply 
wiped out my hard drive because my laptop actually ran Ubuntu even better than it did Windows! Since then I upgraded to Ubuntu 17.04 
and all I can say is that I'm simply elated by how smoothly everything works!!

If I was writing this post 10-15 years back, I would most probably be giving you advice on *how* to install Linux on a laptop. Today, I am more than 
happy to reiterate that this is not the case. Why?...  

... Because everything works as it is supposed to!!

Thank you, Dell and thank you, Ubuntu :)
