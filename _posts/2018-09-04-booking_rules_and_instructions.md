## Rules on Using the Photographic Studio

Please observe the following rules on how to use the Photo Studio in Burt Hall and ensure that you fully understand and comply with them.

After you finish your session, make sure that you:

1. Remove the memory cards from the cameras and place them next to the computer screen.
2. Save all your photos on the shared drive (_P:\_), as well as on your own pen or hard disk drive. After saving your images, delete them from the memory cards– remember that after your session all photographs will be deleted from the memory cards.
3. Put all cameras and filters (UV, IR) back in their cases.
4. Unplug all cables and wrap them properly around the light sources, taking care not to twist or bend them!
5. Ensure that trailing cables do not pose a trip hazard–use the cable bridges to manage cables, if in doubt.
6. Use your UV specs when doing UV photography. Also, make sure that you place the &quot;UV warning sign&quot; outside the door and that the safelight is on.
7. Return all pins and melinex strips to their containers.
8. Do _not_ remove any equipment from the studio!
