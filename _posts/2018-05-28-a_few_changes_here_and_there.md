I have finally quit my PhD. Why? Well, after having spent almost two years trying to juggle between working full-time, doing a PhD, and having a life (ha!), I came to the painful realisation that certain things in life are simply irreconcilable---simple as that, although not quite as obvious to me at first. 

I'm pretty sure that just about anyone who has ever tried to pursue or has successfully completed a PhD will relate to what I'm about to say: PhDs require, among other things, *time* and *proper planning*. Without any of those two essential conditions, trying to do research at that level equates to a dog trying to play chase with its own tail. 

Having said that, bear in mind my dear reader that embarking upon a career in research is not an easy feat. You will need to be equipped with nerves of steel and tons of patience. You will have to renounce the delights of the world---yes, even spending time with your loved ones will soon count as such---and dive right into it. Essentially, you have to lose some to win some. Whether it's worth it or not in the end, well, that's up to you to decide.  

In the end I'm happy to say that I have absolutely no regrets. On the contrary, I feel like a man reborn ever since I emailed my notice of withdrawal to the Graduate School. Who knows? I might be able to post more on this page now that I have successfully claimed part of my life back.
