Having a website --an open channel to communicate with the rest of the world-- and not having the time to use it can be frustrating. Unfortunately, these past 6 months have been extremely busy for me --to the point of exhaustion-- and that is why I haven't had the chance to update this page.

The most important development, which I would like to share with you, is that I've quit my Ph.D. It took me almost 2 years to finally realise that working full-time and doing a part-time Ph.D. at the same time is an impossible feat --- especially if the Ph.D. is for the most part an experimental one. 

I'm pretty sure that just about anyone who has has tried to do or has successfully completed a Ph.D. will relate to what I'm about to say: doing a Ph.D. requires --amongst other things-- *time* and *planning*. Without any of those 2 ingredients, doing a Ph.D. is basically a lost cause; like a dog chasing its own tail. 

In any event, I have absolutely no regrets, and to be honest I feel like a reborn man since I sent my withdrawal email to the Graduate School. Who knows? I might be able to post more on this page now that I have part of my life back.
